# Greg's Pretty Decent BlackJack Project

This project is a BlackJack game with the intent of utilizing Object Oriented programming.  This project also uses collection types to organize and manage data.  Numerous classes and methods were used to build functionality.

The game uses regular BlackJack rules - the player and the dealer are dealt two cards a piece, if either the player or the dealer hit 21 in the first round, the program stops and a winner is declared.  If not, the player can decide to hit or stay.  The dealer is programmed to hit as long as its card total is 16 or under, if its card total reaches 17 or above, the dealer will stay.  If both player and dealer end with the same card total, it will result in a "push"/tie.
